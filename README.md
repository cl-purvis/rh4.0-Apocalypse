# Problem Statement
To reduce the damage farmers have to bear every year due to unpredictable weather.

## Solution Summary
Integrating the data of soil health cards and the weather reports generated, we are creating a system to provide farmers with assistance on how and when to irrigate, sow and harvest the crop. This data would be provided to the farmers using SMS, Mobile-App and 24 hrs Automated Voice Assistance.
